# Milestone 3: Login System with OTP Verification 🔐

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this milestone was to implement a robust authentication and verification layer for the **FitPlan AI** application. To ensure a professional and secure user experience, the system now features database-backed credentials and mandatory 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) via Email OTP before granting access to the personalized fitness dashboard.

## 🛠️ Key Features Implemented

### User Signup & Registration
A dedicated Signup page allows new users to securely register their accounts using an Email ID and Password.

### Database Management
Integration of a backend database to securely store, retrieve, and verify user credentials and profile settings.

### Professional Login Interface
A sleek, split-screen Login page featuring a high-contrast design with a red-tinted gym background on the left and a clean white form on the right.

### 6-Digit OTP Generation
Upon successful password verification, the system automatically generates a unique, time-sensitive 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP).

### Automated Email Integration
The generated OTP is instantly dispatched to the user's registered email address for identity verification.

### OTP Verification Gate
A secondary security page where users must enter the correct code to unlock access to their personalized fitness tools.

### Restricted Dashboard Access
The main application dashboard is strictly locked until the user successfully completes the OTP verification process.
